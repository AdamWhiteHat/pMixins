  Welcome to pMixins!  http://pmixins.com
  
  pMixins is a Mixin (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixins)
  framework for C#.  Mixin code is generated at design time by a Visual Studio plug-in.
  
  Example usage:
  
    //Mixin - Class that contains members that should be injected into other classes.
    public class Mixin
    {
       // This method should be in several class
       public void Method(){ }
    }
  
    //Target (Note: That it is partial) - Add members from Mixin
    [pMixn(Target = typeof(Mixin)]
    public partial class Target{}
  
    //Code Generated by pMixins Code Generator 
    //This is a simplified version of the generated code.
    public partial class Target
    {
       private Mixin _compositionInstance; 
  
       public void Method()
       {
          // forward call to Mixin instance
          _compositionInstance.Method();
       }
    }
  
    //Example of using Target
    public class Consumer
    {
       public void Example()
       {
          var target = new Target();
        
          // can call mixed in method
          target.Method();
        
          // can implicitly convert Target to Mixin
          Mixin m = new Target();
          m.Method();
      }
    }

            <p>
                In the middle of 2012 I was working for a consoulting company on a large asp.net application.
                Like many applications, this one needed to read and write from a datastore.  The application
                was built upon a 3rd party CMS platform, which provided a limited infrastructure for storing data.
                However, we were planning several additions that the built-in data storage api could not sufficently
                handle, so I was tasked with creating an infrastructure for accessing the database directly.

                I have always liked the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html">repository</a> pattern so I 
                went about implementing a class heirarchy to support it.
